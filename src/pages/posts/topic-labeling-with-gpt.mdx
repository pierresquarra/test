# Topic Labeling using OpenAI's API

Github Repo: [github.com/squarra/topic-labeling](https://github.com/squarra/topic-labeling)

Using [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) for topic labeling. The script loads data from the `data` directory and extracts the positive and negative topics of the review in a comma-seperated-format.

**Important note:** The script works best with *gpt-4*. When using *gpt-3.5-turbo*, the semicolon separating the good from the bad topics is not always provided. Errorhandling for this can easily be implemented though.

## Data

 I used a public [amazon dataset](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/) for this. You can replace it with whatever you need. Just make the correct adjustments to the data loading functionality in `main.py`

 ## Example

 When running the script for the first review of the data set *Great product and price!*, the positive topics are *['product', 'price]* and the negative topics are *['']*.
