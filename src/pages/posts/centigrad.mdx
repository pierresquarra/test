# centigrad: Micrograd, just a little bigger

## [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/squarra/centigrad)

Basically forked and expended Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).

## Features

- Computational graph visualization, kind of like Andrej did it in [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero/tree/master/lectures/micrograd)
- Histogram plotting, just like Andrej did it in [makemore](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero/tree/master/lectures/makemore)
- MNIST example (very slow)
- makemore example (very very slow)
