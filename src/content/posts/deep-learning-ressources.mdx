# Deep Learning Ressources

Some intelligent people talking about deep learning and neural networks.

## Videos

### Andrej Karpathy's "Neural Networks: From Zero to Hero"

- [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) (about 13 hours)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero)

About 13 hours of video material. The first video about [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) is insane.

### sentdex's "Neural Networks from Scratch in Python"

- [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3) (about 3.5 hours)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Sentdex/nnfs)
- [Website](https://nnfs.io/)

Some very nice visualizations of the things that happen during a forward pass in a neural network. The series never got to backpropagation.

### MIT's "Introduction to Deep Learning"

- [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI) (about 10 hours)
- [Github Repository](https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning/)
- [Website](http://introtodeeplearning.com/)

A deep learning crash course from MIT. Pretty rushed but touches on a lot of topics.

### 3Blue1Brown's "Neural Networks"

- [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) (about 1 hour)
- [Website](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks)

The first video about neural networks I saw.

### Emergent Garden's "Neural network learns the mandelbrot set"

- [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_UEf8P1IjTjsbPasIQf3jWfQnM0xt0ZN) (about 1 hour)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MaxRobinsonTheGreat/mandelbrotnn)

Absolutely beautiful. This guy has a whole [playlist on about ai art](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_UEf8P1IjTjd2SKwPwCfnqc_GxmmCRFh).
